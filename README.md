# WJTB's Website

I (julia) rewrote the old site in next.js because maintaining a custom router implementation for the old site became too tedious. Also, next.js provides much more powerful static rendering. The switch to video (which should hopefully be done by the time anyone else is reading this) was what finally pushed me to do this.

If you are looking to take my job, please let me know and ill walk you through this codebase (and the rest of our stack).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
